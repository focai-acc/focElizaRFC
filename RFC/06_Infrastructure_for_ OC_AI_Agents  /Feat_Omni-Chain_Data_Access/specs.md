# Overview

focEliza is designed to complement Chainbase's plug-in by enabling fully on-chain AI agents. Built on the Eliza framework, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, and a decentralized architecture (DA), focEliza also leverages Omni-Chain Data Access to bring secure, real-time, and multi-chain insights directly on-chain.

# Core Components

## Fully On-Chain Agent Framework (Eliza)

- **Functionality**: Provides a modular and scalable AI agent framework.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Chainbase's plug-in for accessing blockchain data via natural language interfaces.
- **Deployment**: Agents are deployed directly on-chain via smart contracts.

## Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

- **Confidentiality**: Executes sensitive computations in an isolated and secure environment.
- **Integrity**: Prevents tampering and guarantees that AI agent operations are both confidential and tamper-proof.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatibility

- **Interoperability**: Supports the execution of smart contracts to interface with established blockchain ecosystems.
- **Deployment**: Enables on-chain operations and the seamless deployment of AI agents.

## Decentralized Architecture (DA)

- **Security**: Distributes control across multiple nodes to eliminate single points of failure.
- **Transparency**: Uses distributed ledger technology to provide verifiable and auditable actions without centralized control.

# Omni-Chain Data Access

- **Multi-Chain Integration**: Utilizes Chainbase's plug-in to access and retrieve data across multiple blockchain networks.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures high throughput, low latency, and eventual determinism when interfacing with diverse blockchain environments.
- **Actionable Insights**: Converts raw blockchain data into actionable insights via natural language queries, allowing on-chain agents to make informed decisions autonomously.

# Functional Specifications

## Agent Deployment and Operations

- **Deployment Model**: Fully on-chain deployment via smart contracts, ensuring every action and computation occurs within the decentralized ecosystem.
- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data streams are ingested from Omni-Chain sources provided by Chainbase's plug-in.
- **Processing Workflow**:
  1. Data Ingestion: Retrieve data from multiple blockchain sources.
  2. Computation: Execute AI-driven logic within TEE and EVM environments.
  3. Verification: Log and audit actions via integrated verification mechanisms.

## Security and Verification

- **TEE Isolation**: Ensures critical computations and data processing remain confidential.
- **Remote Attestation**: Enables continuous auditing of agent operations using verifiable logs.
- **Immutable Logging**: Every on-chain action is recorded for full transparency and security.

## Integration with Chainbase's Plug-In

- **Omni-Chain Connectivity**: Direct access to a unified data ecosystem across multiple chains.
- **Seamless Querying**: Natural language interfaces allow agents to query and analyze diverse blockchain data effortlessly.
- **Reliability**: Supports high throughput and deterministic data processing in an on-chain environment.
