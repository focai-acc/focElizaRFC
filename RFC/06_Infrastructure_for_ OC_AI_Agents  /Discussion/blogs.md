As decentralized ecosystems continue to grow, the need for trustworthy, real-time data is critical for advancing AI agents. Chainbase, in collaboration with focEliza, is creating a strong foundation for fully on-chain, verifiable, and autonomous AI agents. By combining robust data access with natural language capabilities, these tools are shaping the next generation of decentralized intelligence.

## Chainbase's Plug-In: Empowering Data-Driven AI Agents

Chainbase's AI plug-in, built for agents leveraging the Eliza's AI agent framework, provides the ability to query and transform on-chain data into actionable insights using natural language. This allows agents to bypass the complexity of raw blockchain data and directly access relevant, analytical insights.

Additionally, the plug-in connects agents with omnichain data, empowering on-chain agents to process information in a reliable, trustworthy manner. This is essential for creating agents capable of making informed decisions without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## focEliza: Fully On-Chain Agents with Verifiable Features

focEliza complements Chainbase's plug-in by focusing on fully on-chain agents built on Eliza, TEE, EVM, and decentralized architecture (DA). It offers a suite of plugins that enable any Eliza-based AI agent to achieve full on-chain functionality, including confidential and verifiable operations. The focEliza Verifiable Terminal adds further transparency, enabling remote attestation and exploration of verifiable logs for on-chain agents.

## Application Scenarios: The Rise of DeFAI Trading Agents

In the rapidly evolving DeFAI (Decentralized Finance and AI) space, trading agents are an ideal application for these advancements. Such agents require access to trustworthy data and analytical capabilities to generate actionable trading insights. With Chainbase's plug-in and Eliza's framework, trading agents can integrate AI capabilities, transforming into fully autonomous, on-chain decision-making entities. These agents will not only analyze and execute trades but also adapt and optimize strategies in real-time, all within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Driving Innovation Through Collaboration

By open-sourcing their tools, Chainbase and focEliza are promoting innovation and empowering developers to create new use cases for decentralized AI. Their joint efforts are enabling seamless data access, verifiable functionality, and autonomous decision-making, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain-powered intelligence.

With these advancements, Chainbase and focEliza are not just supporting current applications like tradingâ€”they are laying the groundwork for a future where decentralized AI transforms industries such as finance, governance, and beyond.
